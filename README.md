# Java Basics — Refreshed

This repo contains notes, examples, and code exercises covering the fundamentals of Java, based on the *“Java Programming for Beginners – Full Course”* video. The idea is to have a handy reference and sample code as you learn or revise.

## Introduction

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language. It’s platform-independent (thanks to the JVM), and widely used for building everything from desktop applications to large-scale enterprise systems and Android apps.

---

## Setup & Tools

- Install the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or above, though newer is better).  
- Use an IDE or editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code (with Java extensions), or NetBeans.  
- Optionally, use build tools like Maven or Gradle for larger projects.

## Core Concepts

### Variables & Data Types

- Primitive types: `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `byte`, `short`.  
- Non-primitive / reference types: `String`, arrays, user-defined objects.  
- Variable declaration, initialization, and scope (local vs instance vs static).

### Operators

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.  
- Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.  
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.  
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.  
- Increment / decrement: `++`, `--`.

### Control Flow

- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`.  
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.  
- The use of `break` and `continue`.

### Methods & Functions

- Method declaration: return type, name, parameters.  
- Calling methods, passing arguments.  
- Return values.  
- Method overloading (same method name, different parameter lists).

### Classes & Objects

- Class definition: fields (attributes), methods (behaviors), constructors.  
- Creating objects with `new`.  
- `this` keyword.  
- Static vs instance members.

### Inheritance & Polymorphism

- Single inheritance in Java (using `extends`).  
- Method overriding.  
- `super` keyword.  
- Runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch).

### Interfaces & Abstraction

- What is an interface; how interfaces differ from classes.  
- Abstract classes vs interfaces.  
- Default methods in interfaces (Java 8+).  

### Exception Handling

- Types of exceptions: checked vs unchecked.  
- `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.  
- Throwing exceptions using `throw`.  
- Best practices.
